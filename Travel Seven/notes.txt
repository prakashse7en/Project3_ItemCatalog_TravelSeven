Hi @prakash_149980138,

Sorry you have to go through this. I would suggest to check if you have sqlite3 installed on your machine. Run the following command in your terminal:
sqlite3

If you get -bash: sqlite: command not found that means you need to install it. Run the following command to install it:

sudo apt-get install sqlite3

Hope this will resolve your issue
Good luck :+1:
